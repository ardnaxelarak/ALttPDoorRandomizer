# Patch Notes

Changelog archive

* 1.4.7.2
  - Fixed an issue with shuffle_ganon/fix_gtower_exit causing a generation failure
  - More HMG fixes by Muffins
* 1.4.7.1
  - Fixed an issue with the repaired "beemizer" setting not being backwards compatible
* 1.4.7
  - Fixed generation error with Big Key in starting inventory (thanks Cody!)
  - HMG/NL logic fixes by Muffins
  - Enemizer: Disabled Walking Zora in the UW due to crash with Swamola (they ignore a lot of collison anyway)
  - Enemizer: Fixed an issue with enemizer bush sprites
  - Enemizer: Banned new Mimics from being the randomized bush sprite due to crash
  - "Beatable" or "accessibility: none" can now use randomized trap doors to seal off entire parts of dungeons (was intended, bug prevented the logic skip)
  - Logic error with enemizer and standard should use new enemy logic rules
  - Fixed a bug with the inconsistent treatment of the beemizer setting
  - Fixed an issue with returning Blacksmith in Simple shuffle (when blacksmith is at Link's House)
  - Fixed an issue with dark sanctuary spawn at tavern north door (thanks Codemann!)
  - Various enemy bans for the last few months
* 1.4.6
  - Restores original Sanc & Quit behavior, if Aga1 is not dead, then no quick pyramid warp
  - Fixed problem with Lite/Lean shuffling some fairy caves unnecessarily
  - The 300 Rupees item is now marked as priority, so it will not be used as GT junk fill (this matches a change in the VT randomizer)
  - Murahdahla is now logically accessible in inverted mode as a bunny. May affect some beatable-only TFH seeds by allowing Moon Pearl to be inaccessible.
  - Fixed an issue around PreferredLocationGroups in customizer which would not work with pre-activated Ocraina or priority items.
  - Minor fix on triforce text
  - Enemy bans for poor placements
* 1.4.5
  - Logic: Added appropriate enemy logic to GT Mimics 1 and 2 rooms
  - Logic: Added appropriate enemy logic to Mire 2 room. Note this does change the default logical strats, due to how enemy kill logic works.
    - Ice Rod + 1 Bomb is now out of logic
    - Fire Rod + 1 Bomb is now out of logic
    - Fire Rod + 1 magic extension is still in logic
    - Byrna + 1 magic extension is newly in logic

    (One magic extension is either half magic or a bottle with the ability to purchase a blue or green potion) In general, making up for a lack of magic extension with a few bombs is something that could be added to the logic. Using the ice rod to freeze an enemy and then using that enemy to deal blunt damage and then using bombs to clear the frozen enemy is another strategy that could be added to the logic someday. If these are important to you, let me know.

            * Hammer or Master sword with 3 magic extensions (Rod spam for elemental heads, non-ideal weapon for last phase)
        * Trinexx on Ice forbidden in doors seeds until we can model some health requirements. Low health Trinexx still isn't realistically feasible (bascially playing OHKO)

* 1.3.0.4v
    * Enemizer: The bunny beam near Lanmo 2 and the 4 fairies near Ice Armos are not shuffled anymore. This is due to how bosses shuffle works and since it cannot be guaranteed to work within the current system, they are vanilla. (Vitreous still overwrites the fairies and Arrghus only lets two spawn, etc.)

    * Mystery/Customizer: true/false and on/off in yaml files should behave the same.

# Known Issues

* Decoupled doors can lead to situations where you aren't logically supposed to go back through a door without a big key or small key, but you can if you press the correct direction back through the door first. There are some transitions where you may get stuck without a bomb. These problems are planned to be fixed.
* Logic getting to Skull X room may be wrong if a trap door, big key door, or bombable wall is shuffled there. A bomb jump to get to those pot may be required if you don't have boots to bonk across.
